# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

It is important for credit card 
companies to be able to identify fraudulent 
credit card transactions so that customers 
are not charged for items they did not 
purchase. Such problems can be solved 
using Data Science and its importance 
along with machine learning cannot be 
overstated. This project aims to illustrate 
data set modeling using machine learning 
with credit card fraud detection. The credit 
card fraud detection problem involves 
modeling past credit card transactions 
with data on those that turned out to be 
fraudulent. This model is then used to 
recognize whether a new transaction is 
fraudulent or not. Our goal is to detect 
100% of fraudulent transactions while 
minimizing fraud misclassifications. 
Credit card fraud detection is a typical 
example of classification. In this process, 
we focused on the analysis and 
preprocessing of datasets as well as the 
deployment of multiple anomaly detection 
algorithms such as Local Outlier Factor 
and Isolation Forest algorithm on PCA 
transformed data of credit card 
transactions.
